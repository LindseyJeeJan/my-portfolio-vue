              Weather Dashboard uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather
              data. The user may search for a city retrieve the current weather

              saves a list of recently searched for cities to quickly retrieve
              tha weather data. This project uses Bootstrap, jQuery and
              Moment.js.

              Provides a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their
              blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts. I built this
              application so that developers can publish articles, blog posts,
              and share thoughts and opinions on technology. This application
              uses NodeJS, NPM, MySQL, Express.js, Sequelize, bcrypt, and
              dotenv.

              Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is
              important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is
              even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to
              our applications success. The user will be able to add expenses
              and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. This
              application uses NPM, MongoDB, Express, Babel and Webpack.

              As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily
              workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout
              on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type,
              weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a
              cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled. A
              consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they
              track their workout progress. The application uses Node, NPM,
              Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and Heroku.
